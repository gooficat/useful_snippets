These are the mini-libraries that I use when programming in c
They include:

c:
- dynamically growing array (not shrinking, but that's a rare thing for me to need), and some macros for making new array types
- colorful printing (windows only right now)
- some delightful macros and typedefs for things like typenames and quicker typedef struct, enum, union
c++:
- a string to binary for c++ because I realized it was missing and needed it once
